# cf-worker-architecture

Set of Kubernetes Operators which manage Cloudflare Workers Deployment into Kubernetes Cluster.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/workerbundle:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/workerbundle:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

## Architecture

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state First {
        JobBuilder
        Registry
    }
    state Second {
        WorkerBundle
        Deployment
    }
    FakeCfApi --> WorkerVersion : create
    WorkerVersion --> WorkerRelease : create or update
    WorkerRelease --> JobBuilder : create
    JobBuilder --> Registry : push
    WorkerAccount --> WorkerBundle : create
    WorkerBundle --> Deployment : create
    Registry --> Deployment : pull
    JobBuilder --> WorkerBundle : update while finished
```

### WorkerAccount

Once the architecture deployed into Kubernetes Cluster, you can create your first account into the architecture :


> **Note** : you need to install wrangler by running `npm i -g wrangler`, run `wrangler login` and get the account ID by
> running `wrangler whoami` and keep it for this step.

you can now apply this resource into kubernetes :

```yaml
apiVersion: api.cf-worker/v1
kind: WorkerAccount
metadata:
  name: YOUR-WRANGLER-ACCOUNT-ID # accounts
  labels:
    accounts: YOUR-WRANGLER-ACCOUNT-ID
spec:
  workerBundleName: "workerBundleName"
  workerReleaseSelector: 
    matchLabels: 
      accounts: YOUR-WRANGLER-ACCOUNT-ID
  podTemplate:
    imagePullSecret: "insert-secret-here"
```
